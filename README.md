# Prediction-of-Coin-Mint-of-the-Roman-Republic-
Libraries used: 
scikit-learn, Pandas, matplotlib, Numpy 

The results of the analysis:
There is imbalance within the data where certain mints lack data. However, for those that have data, the prediction is fairly satisfactory, making this model a good enough model for predicting coins made at mints such as Rome and Luceria.

Data was retrieved from Project Mercury: https://projectmercury.eu/datasets/
